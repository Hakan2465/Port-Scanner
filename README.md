# Port-Scanner
# A port scanner using Nmap and Bash for simplification.
# I used parameters such as T1-5; -Pn; -p; -v; -O
# T1-5 are Timing Templates;
# -Pn disables host dicovery -> nmap doesnt ping and assumes host is active;
# -p is the port parameter -> valuable ports to scan are port 20,21,22,24,25,80,443,8080;
# -v stands for verbosity, giving the user more info about the scan;
# -O detects which OS (Operating System) the target is running
